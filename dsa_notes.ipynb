    "## Dynamic programming and Backtracking:\n",
    "### Dynamic programming\n",
    "Dynamic programming is the general approach of solving a problem by doing sub-problems starting from later steps (e.g. instead of solving the problem on a whole string or from index 0, start from index i>0). Then by memoization/cache, we work our way towards solving the whole problem, referring to the earlier subproblems as needed.\n",
    "There are two general approaches to this:\n",
    "- Top-down dynamic programming: This is where we use DFS and memoization to execute the subproblem driven algo.\n",
    "- Bottom-up dynamic programming: This is where we use a reverse order of traversal such that we only need for loops (no recursion). In general bottom-up tends to be faster due to having no recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the problem requires some form of optimization, i.e. keywords like **largest, smallest, shortest, longest, maximum, minimum** will be in the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking\n",
    "Backtracking is the process of trying out \"paths\" one-by-one. This is really only needed if you can't find any subproblem relationships (so brute force is the only option) and a problem requires you to produce all general solutions or a candidate/valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way a backtracking algorithm can usually be improved is via pruning. This is the process of adding a \"break\" or early cutoff step during the backtracking process, usually requiring some form of sorting of the array/set early on so that we can use the sorted properties to infer that subsequent tries from (for instance) index i will definitely fail.\n",
