    "## Binary search\n",
    "On a sorted array, Binary search is the process of going to the midpoint of arrays until we reach our target. This achieves search in O(logn) time since for an array of size n we only need at most $log_2 n$ steps to narrow down our answer.\n",

    "## Two (or k) pointers: Fast/Slow, Sliding Window, general/directly as pointers\n",
    "### Fast slow pointers\n",
    "The **fast-slow pointers** technique is a method where you have two pointers, the slow one moves in steps of 1 and the fast one moves in steps of 2. This helps to detect things like cycles, midpoints and meeting points, especially in linkedlists and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding window\n",
    "**Sliding windows** refer to any situation where you need to maintain a window of values to calculate on, for example in dynamic programming or a simple moving average. This is typically done by using two pointers, a left and right. However if the \"window\" value is only something basic like a sum, then all that needs to be done is to subtract the previous value and add the next to a running window sum.\n",

    "### Queue\n",
    "Queues follow the first in first out principle, where the first element to go in will be the first to be taken out. They have pop( or dequeue) and push (or enqueue), empty and size, front and rear (looks at queue[0] and queue[-1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deques are queues which allow for popping on both the front and backsides. \n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Queues are implemented via a datastructure called a heap. They are queues which maintain particular structure. In a minheap, the priority queue puts smaller elements in the front. In a maxheap, the priority queue puts larger elements in the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, queues, priority queues and deques are useful in cases where we need to do BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack\n",
    "Stacks follow the first in last out principle, where the most recent element put in will be the first to be taken out. They have top (looks at the top), pop and append/push functionality, and empty (looks at whether its empty), and size (len in python). They can be constructed from queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **monotonic stack** is a stack that maintains its elements in increasing/decreasing order. Whenever a new element is added, it must follow the monotonicity rule:\n",
    "- For a strictly increasing stack, each new element added to the stack must be larger than the next element. If not, elements are popped until this is achieved.\n",
    "- For a strictly decreasing stack, each new element added to the stack must be smaller than the next element. If not, elements are popped until this is achieved.\n",
    "- non-decreasing/non-increasing stacks follow the same principle, just that they also allow equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code for building a monotonic stack from an array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def buildMonoStack(arr):\n",
    "    stack = []\n",
    "    for i in range(arr):\n",

    "## Dynamic programming and Backtracking:\n",
    "### Dynamic programming\n",
    "Dynamic programming is the general approach of solving a problem by doing sub-problems and using the solutions for the subproblems through a recurrence relationship. This speeds things up via memoization since we keep track of useful values. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general approaches to this:\n",
    "- Top-down dynamic programming: This is where we use DFS and memoization to execute the subproblem driven algo.\n",
    "- Bottom-up dynamic programming: This is where we use a reverse order of traversal such that we only need for loops (no recursion). In general bottom-up tends to be faster due to having no recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the problem requires some form of optimization, i.e. keywords like **largest, smallest, shortest, longest, maximum, minimum** will be in the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to keep note of also is that the base/brute solution for any dynamic progamming problem is almost always a **recursive** solution. So if there is recursion, it is likely there is a means of using DP to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of some DP problems with their base recursion logic:\n",
    "- Number of unique paths on a matrix from point A to point B: \n",
    "    - Recursive logic: Number of paths from A to B is number of paths if we move right + number of paths if we move left.\n",
    "    - Memoization: Consider dp[i][j] as the num of unique paths starting from (i,j)\n",
    "- Regex/String pattern matching:\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: Whether a specified regex pattern matches the text depends on whether the text has been used up and whether the pattern matches on one of the two paths (if there is a wildcard pattern like * or ? or .).\n",
    "    - Memoization: Consider dp[i][j] to be T/F for text[i:] and pattern[j:]\n",
    "- Longest valid parentheses:\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: If we consider the longest parentheses substring ending at i and a position behind i, then we can mirror said position across the center of the substring and guarantee similarity in the pattern. Visualization: (..r.c.r..)i where c is the center.\n",
    "    - Memoization: Consider dp[i] to be the length of the longest valid parentheses ending at i\n",
    "- Edit distance/String editing:\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: if word1[i] == word2[j], then word1[i:] compared to word2[j:] is the same as considering the operations for word1[i+1:] and word2[j+1:]. Otherwise, we consider doing 1 operation and considering the remaining strings (e.g. insert will consider word1[i+1:] and word2[j+1:])\n",
    "    - Memoization: Consider dp[i][j] to be the solution to the subproblem word1[:i], word2[:j]\n",
    "- Unique binary search trees\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: The number of unique trees given you've chosen node i out of n nodes as the root is given by the number of unique trees you can form with i-1 nodes on the left time the number of unique trees you can form with n-i nodes on the right\n",
    "    - Memoization: Consider dp[i] to be the number of unique trees with i nodes. \n",
    "    - Sidenote: For the second variant of this problem where you need to generate said trees, you want to use a memo which stores the trees given you start and end at node i and j. The writing out the logic and inserting the small details is easy after that.\n",
    "- Maximal rectangle (Grid/Histogram)\n",
    "    - Generally more easily solvable via monotonic stacks.\n",
    "- Scramble string\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: Inspect every possible partitioning you can perform on the string recursively.\n",
    "    - DP: Memoize the results using a memoization dict memo, mapping partitions (s1,s2) to booleans. \n",
    "- Decode string:\n",
    "    - Recursive logic: If at index i, s[i] is not \"0\", then the number of decode ways from s[i:] is the number of ways from i+1 and i+2, the latter being included if s[i:i+2] is between 10 and 26\n",
    "    - DP: Memoize results for s[i:].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common optimizations on top of dynamic progamming include reducing the dimension of the memoization array (e.g. down to constant size or n from n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix exponentiation for linear recurrence\n",
    "In linear recurrence relations like the Fibonnaci sequence, we can take advantage of linear algebra, eigenvalues, and diagonalization in order to simplify calculations of the nth terms. What's left once the formula is deduced is to simply implement it (which is pretty straight forward) in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bitmask\n",
    "A technique of using the bits of an int or a bit-like array for storage/memoization. This uses a bitset (an array of bits) if not an int.\n",

    "### Knapsack algorithms (0/1, unbounded)\n",
    "The **Knapsack 0/1 problem** goes as follows: suppose you get $n$ items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it and also a bag with capacity $W$ (it can hold max $W$ in weight). You want to maximize the profits you get given you can only take one of each item (hence 0/1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is then the space optimized solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def knapsack(W, values, weights):\n",
    "    # Store the max profit given capacity i\n",
    "    # where i is the index\n",
    "    dp_arr = [0] * (W + 1)\n",
    "    # Does this for every item i\n",
    "    for i in range(0, len(weights)):\n",
    "        # Loops from high to low to avoid including capacities where i has already been taken\n",
    "        for j in range(W, weights[i] - 1, - 1):\n",
    "            # Max between not taking item i and taking item i\n",
    "            dp_arr[j] = max(dp_arr[j], dp[j - weights[i]] + values[i-1])\n",
    "    return dp[W]\n",
    "```\n",
    "It uses an array to store the maximum possible profit you can gain given a capacity of i up to W. Then using the idea of recursive relations, we fill up the array from the back\n",

It can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "- Adding \"#\", \"$#\" and \"#^\" into the original string so that odd and even substrings are treated as odd.\n",
    "- Create a dp array which keeps track of the radius of the palindrome centered at position i in the transformed string.\n",
    "- Keep track of the current center and the right boundary of the farthest right reaching palindrome\n",
    "- Initialize P[i] by min(R-i, P[i_mirror]), where R is the farthest right boundary and i_mirror is the current position mirrored across the center of the farthest right palindrome. Then extend until we find the largest palindrome\n",
    "- Update C and R depending on if our current palindrome reaches farther than R.\n",
    "- Find the maximum in P then convert it back to regular coordinates to get the substring.\n",
